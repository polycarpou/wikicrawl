This is a Breadth First Search algorithm which is used to solve a maze.

To begin writing your own mazesolver, first create the methods listed in the spec. The bfs method puts it all together. The pseudocode for the bfs is as follows:


    bfs(start, looking_for)
      create arrays
      add the start to the arrays
      while the queue is not empty
        take out the first element in the queue
        for each of the neighbours of this first element 
          if its not in the visited set and not blocked
            add this to the arrays
            if this contains what we are looking for
              return the backtrack of this node
            end if
          end if
        end for
      end while
    end method
